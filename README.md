# Wordle-solver
This python script will help you guess the words!
This program is based on 3 function in total.

1st, wrong_letter(wrong letter); with this function you enter a letter that is incorrect.

2nd, correct_letter(correct letter , wrong place of the correct letter); this function takes two inputs. One is the correct letter that is in the wrong place and the wrong place of the correct letter.

3rd, correct_letter_place(correct letter , correct place of the correct letter); this function also takes two inputs. One is the correct letter that is in the correct place and the correct place of the correct letter.

This script works with a cache.txt file that in this file possible correct words are stored and everytime you give new information to the program it will be updated.

Another neccesary file for running this script is 5letterwords.txt . This file is a word list of all 5-letter words. (Because the game is usualy played in 5-letter mode). Of course it can be played in other modes like 4-letter or 6-letter and the script will also function as good as the 5-letter mode.

Hope you like it
